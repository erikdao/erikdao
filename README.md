### Hej! I'm [@erikdao](https://twitter.com/eridao) (Erik Dao) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning engineer from Hanoi, Vietnam. ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

Currently, I'm doing my master studies in machine learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I enjoy building web products in Django, React, AWS, etc. I have been working as a full-stack developer for four years before I started my master.

Starting from 2020, I've dived deeper into machine learning/deep learning, especially computer vision. My main studies and works have been on object detection, semantic segmentation with some of the state-of-the-art models such as vision transformer.

I'm looking for opportunities to work in machine learning in the industry.
