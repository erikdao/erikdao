### Hej! I'm [@erikdao](https://twitter.com/eridao) (Erik Dao) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MLOps Engineer based Stockholm, Sweden. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

Starting from 2020, I've dived deeper into machine learning/deep learning, especially computer vision. My main studies and works have been on object detection, and semantic segmentation with some of the state-of-the-art models such as vision transformer.

Recently, I've started my post as an MLOps Engineer at Epidemic Sound, Stockholm Sweden. I'm now more into tinkering around all aspects on MLOps.
